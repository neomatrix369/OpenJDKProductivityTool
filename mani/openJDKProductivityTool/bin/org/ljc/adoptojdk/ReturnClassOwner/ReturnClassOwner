Story: Utility that you could give a class name to and have it return an owner in
some form, preferably one that is easily mapped to an email address. Not
only would this be useful for what you are asking for here, it would also be
useful for (semi-)automatically directing messages reporting test failures
and so on

or

Generate an email with the email address along with other details of the 
class(es) that failed during testrig tests. Separate emails for separate 
classes. Email should contain errors and failure details, class names and 
other class related details. Log all activities. Reviewer feature.

Narrative:

As a reviewer
I want to be able to retrieve the name and contact details of the submitter using the name of the class failing the test
