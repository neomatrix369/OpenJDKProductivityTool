Response followed by initials

Following are my thoughts.. 
I haven't run the code as I do not have Java 7 installed on my machine.  There was also problem doing git clone with the URL you emailed, I used a parent dir location - 
but I guess that it just a git feature.

1. I find the class names as nouns to be more intuitive. That seems natural as a class represents a types of things / objects.  In current implementation there are some 
verb phrases used i.e., ParseAllCommandLineArguments, ParseEachCommandLineArgument, ReturnClassOwner. I would recommend using appropriate noun names, 
e.g. CommanLineArgumentsParser, etc.
It also seems that the verb classes actually do the work (e.g. parsing) when instantiating the object. Perhaps the work should be done by a separate method 
(e.g. something called parse) which would also return result of parsing. 
In general, I prefer to separate my classes with logic with classes that hold results / data. This allows you to write additional logic that produce / consume same data objects. 

>>> MS, 21/10/12: Class names being changed (underway), will add to to-do list.
>>> MS, 26/10/12: Partially completed.
>>> MS, 16/11/12: Fixed.

2. ParseAllCommandLineArguments 
- Line 16 will be much more readable if method name getErrorStatus is changed to hasError.
- Logic for returning finalErrorMessage seems incomplete, as at present it seems to returns a hard coded string, is that the intention?

>>> MS, 21/10/12: above changes applied
                  finalErrorMessage functionality will be patched soon (underway - already on to-do list)
>>> MS, 26/10/12: fixed, UsageText class created. 

3. ParsedCommandLineArgsResult
toString() - Using acronyms (e.g. rstStr etc.) is perhaps not a good idea, as it either forces the user of the output to either guess your intention or read the code to 
figure out what was the real meaning. Also, I doubt we gain anything by saving a few character here.
>>> MS, 21/10/12: fixed.

Also not sure if there is a need to implement a data holder class like this to be implemented as a mutable object. If implemented as immutable object, class will be much 
simpler with no additional reset logic. 
>>> MS, 21/10/12: will add to to-do list (how do you implement immutable object?).
>>> MS, 16/11/12: I think following page describes it very well: http://www.javapractices.com/topic/TopicAction.do?Id=29
p.s. current version of code is not complex anymore and is reasonable without immutability design. Issue closed. 

4. DatabaseOfOpenJDKContributors
- The class can use some documentation explaining why it exists. The name is bit intriguing as people don't usually write their own databases :)
>>> MS, 21/10/12: Added to to-do list.

- It is also odd that the class has hard coded names inside it. This makes the class non-portable to other projects.
>>> MS, 21/10/12: to be removed during refactoring, will add to to-do list.
>>> MS, 26/10/12: fixed.

- loadDatabaseOfContributors() should perhaps check the string passed to it not empty.
>>> MS, 21/10/12: changed, fixed.

- loadDatabaseOfContributors()  swallows exception without any action. Perhaps it is better to log some error details, e.g. permission denied / file not found or file 
path that was being accessed.
>>> MS, 21/10/12: logging to be implemented, will add to to-do list.
>>> MS, 26-10-12: fixed, logging functionality pending, already on to-do list.

5. A package called "others" is ambiguous, will recommend replacing it with package(s) with specific responsibilities.
>>> MS, 21/10/12: will change when doing other refactoring work, fixed.

6. FullyQualifiedClassName class can use documentation explaining why this class exists, i.e. why are not using ClassLoader.resolve or ClassLoader.loadClass methods instead.
>>> MS, 21/10/12: good idea, didn't know such class methods existed, will add to to-do list.
>>> MS, 13/11/12: fixed.

7. PerformActionWithCommandLineArguments
Line 32 - Use .equals for string comparison to be sure that your code always works correctly.
>>> MS, 21/10/12: fixed.

8. ReturnClassOwner can also perhaps use some documentation, in particular it is not clear who / what is a "class owner" and how is it different from "return-class owner"
>>> MS, 13/11/12: ReturnClassOwner has been renamed to ClassContributorRetriever, does this resolve the confusions?
>>> MS, 16/11/12: Code review response, Yes it does - not confusing anymore. Issue closed.

9. ReturnClassOwnerScenario & ReturnClassOwnerSteps - should these classes be under test source folder?
>>> MS, 21/10/12: not sure yet, need to consult BDD experts - added to the to-do list.

10. Like the idea of fluency class, it makes the code readable. However, I have observed it is used only from test cases. If that is the intention, it should perhaps live in 
test source folder.
>>> MS, 21/10/12: added to the to-do list.
>>> MS, 22/10/12: moved to test folder, fixed.

11. There are several warnings (by eclipse).
>>> MS, 16/11/12: To be fixed. Added to the to-do list. Fixed.

12. ClassContributorRetrieverScenario seems to have been duplicated (with minor differences) as ClassContributorRetrieverScenario.story
>>> MS, 16/11/12: I need them, as two different aspects of JBehave require them. One of them looks for a .story file while the other does not. Fixed. 

13. Unit tests for some classes are missing. e.g. FullyQualifiedClassName, ResolveSimpleNameClassName
>>> MS, 16/11/12: Added to the to-do list. 

14. Code formatting does not seem standard, i.e. eclipse / sun convention. Being the author it's your choice. However, staying with a style supported by your IDE will keep 
the formatting consistent.
>>> MS, 16/11/12: Added to the to-do list. 

15. CommandLineArgumentsParser - ParseArguments method name should start with lower case as per java conventions.
>>> MS, 16/11/12: Will need to apply it to all classes. Added to the to-do list. 
 
16. IndividualArgumentParser - on exception,  the error message is set twice causing the first message to be lost. 
>>> MS, 16/11/12: Will need to check why? Added to the to-do list. 

17. Like the way behaviour tests are written e.g. CommandLineArgsParserBehaviour
>>> MS, 16/11/12: Inspired by BDD, will continue to do so. No immediate action required.

18. Like the SVG diagram, it's great for showcasing the role of this tool in development process.
>>> MS, 16/11/12: I'm a flow and diagram person, always like to understand how things work before jumping into coding. No immediate action required.

Test Cases:

DatabaseOfOpenJDKContributorsBehaviour & ReturnClassOwnerBehaviour
1. Use of assertNotNull / assertEquals would be better instead of using assertTrue with calls to == or equals because in case of test failure those methods will generate more 
meaningful error messages.
>>> MS, 21/10/12: applied suggestion throughout the code-base, fixed.

2. Some comments are redundant (e.g. ReturnClassOwnerBehaviour lines 61-69), it is very clear what the code does there and there is no need for comments.
>>> MS, 21/10/12: thanks, i'll keep the comments for now and remove during refactoring and static testing. Added to to-do list.

3. Just wondering if there was any reason for choosing junit? Here is a pitch for choosing testng over junit: 
http://kaczanowscy.pl/tomek/sites/default/files/testng_vs_junit.txt.slidy_.html#%281%29   Perhaps a quick check from testing/BDD experts would be a good thing to do.
>>> MS, 21/10/12: Will give it a thought. Added to to-do list.

4. IndividualArgumentParser - on exception, there does not seem to be a test case that causes an exception. 
>>> MS, 16/11/12: Will need to add it to the list of tests? Added to the to-do list.
